Goal : Analyze the [Sklearn wine dataset](https://scikitlearn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html) and use the properties to predict the variety of the wine.

# Load the data
Load the data into memory and then process the data. (sklearn.datasets.load_wine())

# Split the data into training and test
Please make sure that the data is divided randomly and that the classes are balanced. 70% of the data should be used for training.

# Train a suitable algorithm
Select a suitable algorithm to predict the varieties of wine. Train the algorithm.

# Test the algorithm on the test data.
Calculate at least one measure of the accuracy of the prediction.

# Illustrate your result
Graphically illustrate how many wines of each class were correctly predicted.
