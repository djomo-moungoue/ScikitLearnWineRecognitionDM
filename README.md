# MachineLearningZa
Goal : Analyze the [Sklearn wine dataset](https://scikitlearn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html) and use the properties to predict the variety of the wine.

# Load/import the data (1)
Load the data into memory and then process the data. (sklearn.datasets.load_wine())

# Clean the data

# Split the data into training and test sets (2)
Please make sure that the data is divided randomly and that the classes are balanced. 70% of the data should be used for training.

# Create a model

# Train (the model) a suitable algorithm (3)
Select a suitable algorithm to predict the varieties of wine. Train the algorithm.

# Test the algorithm on the test data. (4)
Calculate at least one measure of the accuracy of the prediction.

# Make predictions

# Illustrate your result (5)
Graphically illustrate how many wines of each class were correctly predicted.

    - It is more convenient than editors like VS Code for machinelearning projects, because it can better display long row of data.
    - It is installed via the installation of the Anaconda distribution.
